==============================
BUZZKILL (WoW 1.12)
===================

Auto-removes selected buffs from YOUR character as soon as they appear.
Built for Vanilla/Turtle 1.12. Includes an in-game UI, profiles, and a quiet mode.

---

## WHAT IT DOES

* Shows a categorized list of common buffs (Paladin, Priest, Mage, Druid,
  Warrior, Shaman, Warlock, Scrolls).
* You check the buffs you do NOT want. If a checked buff appears on you,
  BuzzKill cancels it immediately.
* Scans on login and whenever your auras change (throttled for performance).

---

## FEATURES

* Simple two-column checkbox UI with class headers.
* Slash commands to open/close the UI: `/buzzkill`, `/bk`.
* Silent by default (chat messages OFF until you enable them).
* Notification toggle: `/bknotify` to turn chat messages ON/OFF or view status.
* Profiles: save / activate / delete named profiles.
  The built-in profile "Standard" is protected (cannot overwrite or delete).
* Paladin support includes "Heathen's Light".
* Safe removals: cancels by buff index and iterates downward to avoid skips;
  aura scanning is throttled.

---

## INSTALLATION

```
Interface/AddOns/Buzzkill
```

2. Put these files in that folder:

## PERFORMANCE & BEHAVIOR

* Scans on `PLAYER_LOGIN` and `PLAYER_AURAS_CHANGED` with a 0.2s throttle.
* Removes only YOUR buffs (not party/raid members).
* Uses tooltip text to match the buff name shown on your character.

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

* UI not opening? Ensure files are in `Interface/AddOns/Buzzkill/` and the addon
  is enabled at the character select screen.
* A buff isnâ€™t being removed? Make sure its name is checked and spelled exactly
  as it appears in your client.
* Duplicate buffs with the same name/icon (e.g. Heathen's Light)? Removal is
  name-based; checking that name removes any that match.
* Too much chat spam? Use `/bknotify off` (default is OFF).

---

## CHANGELOG

1.0.0

* Initial release for 1.12 clients.
* English UI and messages.
* Added Paladin buff Heathen's Light.
* Added `/bknotify` (silent by default).
* Safer scan/removal loop and throttle.
